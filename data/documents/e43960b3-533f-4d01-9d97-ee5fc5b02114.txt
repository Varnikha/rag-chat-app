        This is the first paragraph of our test document. It contains multiple sentences that will help us test the chunking functionality. Each sentence provides meaningful content for testing.
        
        This is the second paragraph. It discusses different aspects of document processing and text chunking. The system should be able to handle various types of content and create meaningful chunks.
        
        The third paragraph focuses on RAG systems. Retrieval Augmented Generation is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It allows AI systems to access external knowledge.
        
        Finally, the fourth paragraph concludes our test document. It ensures we have enough content to create multiple chunks with proper overlap. This helps test the chunking algorithm thoroughly.
        
        Additional content for testing includes technical terms like embeddings, vector databases, and similarity search. These concepts are crucial for RAG implementations.
