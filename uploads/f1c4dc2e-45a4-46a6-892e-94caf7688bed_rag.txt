RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI framework that enhances the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving information from external data sources before generating a response. By connecting LLMs to a knowledge base, RAG improves the accuracy, relevance, and timeliness of their output, reduces the tendency to "hallucinate" incorrect information, and provides citations to authoritative sources, making AI-generated content more trustworthy and context-aware without requiring extensive model retraining.
